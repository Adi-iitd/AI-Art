## Motivation

Creativity is something we closely associate with what it means to be human. But with digital technology now enabling machines to recognize, learn from and respond to humans and the world, an inevitable question follows: 

> Can machines be creative? And will artificial intelligence ever be able to make art?

Recent art experiments is the use of "generative adversarial networks" (GANs). GANs are "neural networks" that teach themselves through their own experimentation, rather than being programmed by humans. *It could be argued that the ability of machines to learn what things look like, and then make convincing new examples, marks the advent of "creative" AI.*
